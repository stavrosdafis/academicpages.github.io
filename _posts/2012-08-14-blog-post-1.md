The risk assessment related to the formation of intense
tropical-like cyclones (TLC) or the so-called “Medicanes”
over the Mediterranean Sea is crucial in order to limit the
socioeconomic damages mostly in islands and coastal areas
(Michaelides et al., 2017). Even though cyclones that attain
characteristics of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean is a
debatable issue, a Medicane can be defined as an intense,
maritime warm-core cyclone that forms in the Mediterranean
basin with a cloud-free eye formation and surface winds
above gale force. Very few studies exist so far regarding surface
or 3D observations of Medicanes and the main reason is
that these systems very rarely make landfall and thus, our
understanding of the role of deep convection within these
systems is limited to satellite retrievals. Lagouvardos et al.
(1999) investigated the case of a TLC between Sicily and
Greece in 1995 using infrared imagery and documented the
presence of deep convection (DC) prior to TLC genesis, as
well as the weak baroclinic instability contribution to the
evolution of the cyclone, by using a mesoscale model.
Luque et al. (2007) analysed satellite retrievals to construct
the trajectories of three Medicanes between 1995 and 2005
and estimated precipitation features from microwave measurements.
They concluded that the temporal evolution of
Medicanes consists of three stages: the pre-eye, the stationary
phase and the itinerant phase. Claud et al. (2010) used
NOAA/MetOp satellite observations to investigate three
